## Value-Add Use Cases

In addition to the core use cases, Mojaloop supports the implementation
of a number of more complex use cases, which add additional features and
are layered over the top of the core use cases.

The most prominent of these is Merchant Payments, which adds a Merchant
Registry function externally to the Mojaloop Hub, and supports the
generation of QR codes for the routing of payments from customers with
smartphones to merchants, linked to merchants' existing systems. This is
in parallel to support for USSD-based merchant payments.

Other use cases supported include collections, agent-facilitated cash
in/out, ATM withdrawals and cross-border payments. Further
service-specific use cases can readily be added by individual scheme
operators.
