This Product Council session focussed on Participation Tools: Payment Manager/PM4ML, Payment Hub EE, SDK, etc.

It was led by James Bush of the Mojaloop Foundation, and the rough agenda was:
Sharing of experiences onboarding experiences (technical and business related)
Recap of existing participation tools (SDK, PHEE, PM4ML)
Brainstorming of the problem space with relation to existing tools, which fit where, what gaps are there?

With the aim of shaping the Participation Tools workstream, and informing the overall Mojaloop Roadmap.
