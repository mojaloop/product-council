This week's Product Council focussed on the integration of TigerBeetle into the Mojaloop codebase, which will see TigerBeetle becoming the fundamental accounting ledger implementation for Mojaloop.

This workstream is very much in its early stages, with details still to be defined. However, the details of how TigerBeetle-based accounting will work are close to finalisation, and Michael Richards agreed to brief the Community on this fundamental aspect of the integration.
