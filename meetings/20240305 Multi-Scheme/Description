This Product council meeting (held on Tuesday, 27th February 2024) discussed "The Practical Aspects of a Multi-Scheme Deployment".

During the current PI, a lot of effort has been expended on multiple workstreams focussed on foreign exchange, as a necessary pre-requisite for a number of cross-border deployments. This Product Council session focussed on what is needed to build on this work to create a functional deployment across multiple schemes, such as is envisaged in the COMESA RFP.
 
Everyone with an interest in multi-scheme, cross-border, multi-jurisdiction, multi-currency deployments is encouraged to view this recording â€“ but in particular anyone involved in responding to the COMESA RFP.
 
Michael Richards presented, and Jonathan Pinifolo, representing the COMESA Business Council, joined the meeting to say a few words.
