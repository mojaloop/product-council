This week’s Product Council was a double session, with two workstreams that needed to engage with the Community:

- Deployment Tools, led by James Bush
This workstream is concerned with the provision of tools, documentation and support to enable adopters to deploy the Mojaloop software in a variety of environments, cloud and on-premises.

- Core and Releases, led by Sam Kummary
The Mojaloop Core and Releases workstream aims to maintain the Mojaloop core (maintenance items such as fixes to critical bugs, prioritized feature enhancements, node upgrades) and undertakes the Release process of the core services and some adjacent services or products that are part of the Mojaloop Platform.
The workstream also aims to support technical workstreams delivering features to core or supporting services by helping package services that are of release quality (the new features need to follow Mojaloop’s adopted quality standards and best practices such as automated tests, documentation, helm charts and such). This involves the community support aspect as well.
Recently, a focus of this workstream has been the integration of the outputs of the interscheme, fx and ISO 20022 workstreams into Mojaloop Irrawaddy (V17.x.x), a significant release on the Mojaloop roadmap. Sam gave us an update on this process, and talk about the work to come.
