This week’s Product Council was dedicated to a presentation by Kimmo Soramäki of FNA.
 
Entitled “Countering Consumer Fraud and Scams with National Fraud Portals”, Kimmo discussed how to use national cross-bank, cross-scheme payments data to recover funds for victims and stop fraudulent payments.
 
FNA (https://fna.fi/) offers a service which is complementary to that envisaged by Tazama/FRMS – where Tazama is dedicated to a particular deployment, FNA integrates with services such as Tazama to deliver cross-scheme anti-fraud capabilities.
