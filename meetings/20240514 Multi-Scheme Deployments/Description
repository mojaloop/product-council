This Product Council meeting again focussed on the Multi-Scheme Deployment workstream. The reason for this repeated focus is the reliance of much of the existing Mojaloop Roadmap on the outputs of this workstream. In order to support this, we need to progress the definitions of objectives, user stories, acceptance criteria etc.
 
Attendees to this meeting, which was led by WS co-leads Julie Guetta and Innocent Kawooya - were urged to familiarise themselves with the background, and in particular the two documents that were presented at the previous session. They can be found here: https://github.com/mojaloop/product-council/tree/16d86fd27e6127847b0452eeaa712ae398e24c41/meetings/20240430%20Multi-Scheme%20Deployments
 
This session also made use of a “storification” of the design set out in those documents, prepared by Michael Richards.
