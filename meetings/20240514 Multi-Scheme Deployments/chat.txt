11:39:51	 From Paysys Labs : The adoption of Mojaloop in cross border payments will involve it to interact with Non Mojaloop scheme. So in terms of Product design the solution should consider this on priority.
11:40:37	 From Aung Thaw Aye - ThitsaWorks : Reacted to "The adoption of Moja..." with üëç
11:42:53	 From Michael Richards : Replying to "The adoption of Moja..."

Mojaloop can do this, but there may be serious impacts on cost. All of these proposals are designed towork whether the schemes are all Mojaloop or include non-Mojaloop schemes. If you see anywhere where you think that's not true, let me know.
11:50:11	 From Paysys Labs : Replying to "The adoption of Moja..." 

 For starters, no pay...
11:52:22	 From Michael Richards : Replying to "The adoption of Moja..."

It is for those payment schemes to decide how to make that mapping. We cannot design for them; but they will have to do that, or something like it, to be able to participate in a network with any other (not just a Mojaloop) scheme)
11:57:44	 From Paysys Labs : Question:

 It is not clear what is this design  trying to achieve.?
11:59:38	 From James Bush : Replying to "Question:

 It is no..."

do you mean the identifier resolution by the oracle?
12:00:37	 From Paul Makin : Everyone, I‚Äôd like to emphasise as Product Director that this implementation does not pretend to be an end point. It should instead be seen as a first solution, and that we of course envisage it evolving in the future to meet other requirements.
12:00:46	 From Michael Richards : Replying to "Question:

 It is no..."

It's designed to respond to criticisms of the original design made by, er, you

No good. The creditor DFSP is the arbiter of whether the transfer is finalised, in our model

All the switch will see is a proxy?
12:23:09	 From Michael Richards : Replying to "If scheme 3 gets a r..."

If a scheme joins somewhere else on the chain, how will it know that?
12:23:28	 From Julie Guetta : Replying to "The adoption of Moja..."

We have a specific workstream for this
12:23:58	 From Paysys Labs : Replying to "The adoption of Moja..." 

 Which one?
12:25:52	 From Steve Haley : Recent discussions with BIS and SWIFT make me more confident that there will be adequate demand for multi-scheme that meets these higher assumptions.
12:27:00	 From Paysys Labs : I am not aware of this discussions. If you can share the details
12:30:39	 From Steve Haley : Sorry - my recent discussions - informal chats that the changes to ISO and the two phases will be required by them in the future - so it is worthwhile to focus on the ideal and let adopters design the compromise (as James just said)
12:37:09	 From Julie Guetta : Perhaps we can look at the flow in details for TCIB and PAPSS so that Karim's concerns are addressed? Surely we can take it as a priority action for this workstream

 Thanks. Pls
12:38:29	 From Paul Makin : Replying to "Perhaps we can look ..."

Julie, you‚Äôre co-lead on both work streams, so you are in the prime position to coordinate that.
12:39:16	 From Paul Makin : Replying to "Perhaps we can look ..."

There have always been strong synergies between the work streams, and I‚Äôd be happy to support you in this.
12:40:28	 From Julie Guetta : Replying to "Perhaps we can look ..."

Perfect. I think we have a workable approach
12:40:53	 From Julie Guetta : Replying to "Perhaps we can look ..."

@Luis Roy Zulu | PBS, any news on the clearing specifications? I need this to crack on I am afraid
12:41:30	 From Paysys Labs : Yes ok

12:52:16	 From Steve Haley : Amazing session!
