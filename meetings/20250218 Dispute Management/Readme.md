This weekâ€™s Product Council was led by Promesse Ishimwe, the lead for the Dispute Management workstream.
 
Promesse gave a short presentation of progress so far, including the first output: the structure for the dispute management process, including flows and responsibilities. This is currently limited in application to a payments scheme based around a single Mojaloop Hub. Future iterations of the structure will address first the multiple Mojaloop scenario, then extend further to encompass (as far as is practicable) the multi-scheme scenario.

Also in this folder is the draft dispute management framework, prepared by Promesse.
