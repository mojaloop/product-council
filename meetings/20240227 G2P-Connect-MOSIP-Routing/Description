This Product council meeting (held on Tuesday, 27th February 2024) discussed, the G2P Connect/MOSIP Routing workstream.

Whilst this workstream ostensibly focusses on the routing of payments to a digital identity (MOSIP, in this case), the underlying purpose of this is the support of G2P social payments through integration with the Open G2P beneficiary management system (BMS), and wider facilitation of payments in an interoperable Digital Public Infrastructure.

It was highlighted during this meeting that the outputs of this workstream have wider applicability, and could form the basis of multiple, flexible payments routing solutions in the future.

The session was presented by Paul Baker.
