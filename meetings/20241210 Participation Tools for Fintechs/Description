This week’s Product Council focussed on the work being done to facilitate the participation of fintechs in a Mojaloop-based payments scheme, using the PISP interface. This is to be achieved through the development and adoption of a solution similar to the ITK solution for DFSPs, that is, an integration toolkit that exists within the fintech’s domain.

This workstream is complementary to the PISP workstream; whereas that workstream looks towards the Mojaloop Hub (and focusses on the interactions between the ITK and the Hub), this workstream looks outwards, towards the fintech, and provides an Open Banking-style interface.

The workstream lead, Alan Kajangwe of WiredIn, presented this update.
