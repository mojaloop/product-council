Today's Product Council looked at the work of the ISO 20022 workstream, and was led by Julie Guetta, WS lead. She was joined by Paul Baker, who is leading the implementation of the ISO 20022 messaging structure proposed to the ISO 20022 RMG, and James Bush, who presented an approach for those adopters who already have some form of ISO 20022 integration with DFSPs.
