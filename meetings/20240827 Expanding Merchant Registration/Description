This Product Council session aimed to build on our work in recent PIs on alternative aliases for payments routing, including merchant payments (routing a payment to a merchant ID) and MOSIP routing (routing a G2P social payment to a beneficiaryâ€™s digital/national identity).

There is an opportunity to extend and generalise this to facilitate routing of payments to logical entities (companies, governments and NGOs) and natural entities (people) through partnerships with organisations that focus on the relevant digital identity sectors, in particular in identity assurance, management and issuance.
