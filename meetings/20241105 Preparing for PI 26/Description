This session of the Product council was focussed on preparations for PI 26 and the upcoming Convening in Kigali. I presented the workstream dashboard, updated at least weekâ€™s meeting of WS leads, and reviewed the existing roadmap to discuss how it needs to be updated and extended in the light of those WS updates.

The Miro board I used to discuss the roadmap is here: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLJhYwSY=/?share_link_id=759318539506 (that link gives your "comment" access)
