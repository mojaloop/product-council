The purpose of this Product Council meeting was to review and refine the objectives for the Multi-Scheme Deployments workstream, set out the acceptance criteria, and support the workstream leads in getting this workstream properly kicked off.
 
This is an important workstream because of its central role in the operation of regional (cross border) deployments of Mojaloop, and is a constraint on the development of the Merchant Payments workstream in its aim to support cross-border merchant payments.
