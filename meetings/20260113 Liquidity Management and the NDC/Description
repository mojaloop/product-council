This Product Council session focussed on discussions around the risks a Mojaloop scheme is vulnerable to 
if liquidity management is not properly enforced by a scheme owner/operator. The session also highlighted
the role of the Net Debit Cap (NDC) and its intended purpose. 

It was led by Paul Makin of the Mojaloop Foundation. The recording of the session is available at
