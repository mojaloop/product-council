This Product Council session is intended to prepare us for the upcoming Convening. I will present the existing Roadmap, and we can discuss the candidate workstreams for PI 24. These are mostly based on discussions held at Product Council over the last few months, plus there are one or two that have come up outside PC.
 
The objective is to make sure that we are in good shape for the Convening.
